          <p>I still remember my senior year in high school. I had quit the basketball team -- which would prove to be temporary -- and I chose to take an elective called "Computer Science". The class taught me how to creat PONG. Oh, how neat. At the time, it was just something to get through the school year. I would never expect how it would change my career outlook ten years later. <br /><br />Later that school year, I would find myself dropping the Computer Science elective and returning to playing basketball. I would maximize my athletic potential and finally graduate high school with the same prospects that a lot of high school graduates have, now what? For me, that would become a seemingly endless cycle of full schedule semesters at the local community college as I tried to figure out what career path I would take. <br /><br />The school grind began to come with a never ending feeling of tiresome monotony so I decided to take a break from my academics and dedicate my time to work so with the intention of saving as much money as I could while reassessing my plans for going to college. Fortunately for me, I wasn't alone in this life reassment. My older brother, who happened to be in a similar circumstances as me at the time, was in the midst of doing his own research about useful college degrees that have value and demand in the real world. One happened to stand out to him above the rest. I still remember the day when he asked me, "Hey, bro, have you heard about this thing called coding?". I would contemplate for a moment before responding, "Yeah, like pong".</p>
