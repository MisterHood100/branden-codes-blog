          <p>What's up, my name is Branden Hood and this is Branden Codes, my personal blog where I'll be documenting my progress towards becoming a professional front-end web developer. So, here's a little about me. I'm a Game-A-Holic, advid reader, comic book fan, music lover that once thought I would make it big as a rapper or producer, irrationally optimistic propspective screenwriter and basketball fanatic. As a matter of fact, I played organized basketball starting in elementary all the way through junior college. It wasn't until I realized that my basketball talents might have peaked in my senior year in high school that I first discovered coding. But that's a story for another day. For now I'll just say that things seemed to have come full circle. As things stand currently, I am learning as much as I can about web development and design with ambitions of having a full time career in coding. Follow along with me and let's see where this journey leads.</p>
